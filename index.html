        <h1>DAT Minor: module arduino, programming and electronics</h1>
        <h2>General description</h2>
        <p>In this module, you will get introduced into methods and techniques you can use for you own project. Though DAT minor is neither a programming nor an electrical engineering course, some basic knowledge of both is required in order to get the most out of this minor. When you are familiar with these basics, you will know what is possible and what not â€“ and how to get help or more information.</p>

        <p>The module consists of four pressure cooker lab courses of four hours each (from 13:00 - 17:00 on Fridays in the first four weeks of the term). During these courses, general theory and practical applications will be introduced in a planairy format. After this introduction, you will work for ten to thirty minutes on several hands-on exercises, so you can get to grips with these materials (both physical as intellectual). During these minutes, teachers and TA's will walk around to answer (and ask) questions. When the exercises are finished, the course will continue planairy again with the next topic. This cycle is repeated until all the materials have been treated (or the time is finished).</p>

        <p>Every lab course has both preperations and assignments, both of which are required (we assume you have done the preperation <i>before</i>) the lab course and will check your elaborations of the assignments).</p>

        <h1>Assessment</h1>
        <p>Following the four weeks period, you have two weeks to create a project for <a href="assessment.html">the assessment</a> (called: <i>Making Silent Things Speak</i>. You need to work with a partner on this assessment. In week 6 of the minor, plenary presentations of all the elaborations will be held.</p>

        <h1>Time requirements</h1>
        <p>This module accounts for half the credits the complete module Programming and Electronics (OSIRIS CODE HERE) (the other half of this grade depends on the way in which you incorporate the knowledge gained in this module in your end project). So you need to put in (5 &times; 28 / 2 = 70) seventy hours of work. This results in the following overview:</p>

        <table>
            <tr><td>Four lab courses of four hours each</td><td>4 &times; 4 = 16 hours</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Four times preperations</td><td>4 &times; 2 = 8 hours</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Four times assignments</td><td>4 &times; 4 = 16 hours</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Working on the project for the assessment</td><td>3 & times 8 = 24 hours</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Planairy presentation of the assessment</td><td>1 &times; 4 = 4 hours</td></tr>
            <tr><td><b>total labour</b></td><td><b>68 hours</b></td></tr>
