        <h1>Preparation</h1>
        <p>Last week, we introduced several basic components: resistors, capacitors and transistors. In this week, we will use this knowledge to have several of these components work together. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Study <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Logic-Gates-with-NPN-transistors/">this site on logical gates</a>. Though we're not going to use them all, it's good to know what each one is and how they work.</li>
            <li>Have a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDmHVRC6pQk">this video</a> (5:58) explaining the timing aspects of capacitors.</li>
            <li>Look at the first eleven minutes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDmHVRC6pQk">this video</a>, explaining how servo motors work (you can skip over the parts on gears, if you want). The last four minutes of this video are about controlling the servo motor with an arduino, which we are not going to do this week.</li>

        <h2>Exercise 1: Signal inversion</h2>
        Last week, we introduced several logical gates: we made an OR-gate and worked on an AND gate. One of remaining gates is the NOT-gate, whose truth-table can be found below. Basically, this gate functions as a signal-inverter: it returns whatever is NOT inputted.

        <table class="truth-table">
            <tr><th>A</th><th>NOT A</th></tr>
            <tr><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>
            <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
        </table>

        Just to get your juices flowing at the start of this lab-course, we are going to make this relatively simple circuit. In the assignment for this week, we will be using this signal-inverter in quite some detail (however, we will use an integrated circuit in this case).

        <h2>Exercise 2: Timing an event</h2>
        <p>Timing is an essential part in most computing processes, and the system we are creating here is used in lots of modern day systems (of course in integrated circuits and a bit more acccurate, but still).</p>
    
        <p>Have a look at the circuit below. With the switch open, current flows from the positive source throught R2 to the base of the transistor, thereby allowing current to flow over R3 and the LED back to the ground.</p>
    
        <p>When we close the switch, current flows over R1 to the capacitor in the middle, allowing it to charge itself. However, as you know a fully charged capacitor can be seen as an open switch, so the previous flow of the current (with the switch open) is restored once the capacitor is completely charged.</p>

        <p class="center">
            <img class="image" src="imgs/timed-circuit-fritzing.png" alt="A model of the breadboard">
        </p>
    
        <p>Re-create this circuit on your own breadboard and see what happens when you close the switch. Can you explain in your own words why the circuit functions as it does? Why is it important that <b><i>R2</i></b> &Gt; <b><i>R1</i></b>? Experiment with different values for the capacitor; can you explain the differences in behavior?</p>

        <h1>Exercise 3: An astable vibrator</h1>

        <p>Now that we know how to time an event and the effects of capacitors connected to the base of a transistor, we can use that knowledge to have two seperate transistors connected to two seperate capacitors. </p>

        <p>Have a look at the schematic below. The voltage on the left side of C2 controls transistor T1. The voltage on the right side of C1 controls transistor T2. When transistor T1 turns ON, it changes the voltage of C1 so that T2 turns off. After a short while, the voltage of C1 rises back up and turns on the transistor T2. When transistor T2 turns on, it changes the voltage of C2 so that T1 turns off. This keeps repeating.</p>

        <p>So what do you think will happen?</p>

            <img class="image" src="imgs/flipflop-fritzing.png" alt="A model of the breadboard">
        </p>
        
         <p>Re-create this circuit on your own breadboard â€“ you probably need to add some resistors between the high voltage and the LEDs, as is shown in the lower image. When you're done, switch it on (give current to it). If all goes well, you have just created your first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivibrator">astable multivibrator</a>. This is a system that can be in one of two <em>states</em> and is used frequently in all kinds of applications.
             
         <p>Now experiment with different values for the resistors and/or the capacitors. Make sure you understand why the circuit is doing what it is doing. Also try to replace one (or both) of the resistors with a sensor. Document your findings using images and text.</p>
