<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Our human senses are quite confined: any sound above twenty kilohertz will pass unnoticed, any lightwave with a length below 380 or above 750 nanometer remains invisible, or any temperature below 40 or above 60 degrees centigrade will probaly freeze or burn your skin. Other animals have quite different (and often better) perceptual modalities and plants react to the lengths of the days and the humidity of the soil. One could even argue (as the philosopher Walter Benjamin does) that everything (including stones or planets) has its own language (though he uses the German word 'Sprache' which is not exactly the same as 'language').</p>
<p>When we want or need to communicate with entities that speak in a manner that we are unable to understand, we use technology to translate their means of communication in a way that we can comprehend. We use telescopes to investigate the movements of the moons of Jupiter, we employ bubble champers to envisage the interactions of invisible particels, we film a running horse in order to make his suspension visible.</p>

<h2 id="assignments">Assignment</h2>

<p>Using sensors and the arduino, we can transform the allegedly mute environment into something that makes sense to us. We can use an array of temperature sensors to measure the heat stress a large building is currently experiencing, use different light sensors to experience the amount of sugar a plant is currently producing, or use an ultrasone microphone to see what prey a bat is currently after.</p>
<p>In this assignment, you are required to come up with an idea among those lines. Think about an entity that experiences its environment in a way that is completely arcane to us, and figure out ways in which these experiences can be translated so that we can actually understand what's going on.</p>
<p>You could, for example, think about the environment of a plant. A plant experiences sunlight, temperature, and humidity (among other things) – all aspects we can measure using different kind of sensors. Using these measurements, we can create a visualisation that makes us aware of the way this plant is currently in its world. When the temperature is too hight, e.g., a red led will start to shine – when too cold, it could be a blue led.</p>
<p>Once you have done this, you could use this make this translation both ways. Could we react to whatever the mute entity is telling us, and in what way should we do that. Or perhaps you can even create communication between different silent entities (assuming that the communication between the same kind of entities comes natural).</p>


<h2 id="description">Desciption of the project</h2>
<p>Make a small installation in which you make the communication with the mute entities explicit. Of course, you are required to work with technology (e.g. the arduino), sensors and actors. A species of the mute entity you are working with should be at center stage of this installation.</p>
<p>You need to do this project in a small group (max four students). Divide the idea in as much non-trivial tasks as there are students in your group, so that everyone in responsible for one task. That being said, every group member is responsible for the whole project and everyone should be able to explain all the details.</p>
<p>You should document all steps in the process, using photo's, mind-maps, online editors, some sort of collaboration tool (trello, github, ...), video's, texts, ...</p>
<p>During the project, please keep the following questions in your mind:</p>
<p>What kind of communication are you after? What kind of information is the silent entity trying to parley to us? Try to think about the world the entity is living in and how this is different from our world.</p>
<p>Why do you make the translation that you do? Why do you think that this translation is correct? What in the world of the silent entity corresponds to what in our world?</p>
<p>How do you envisage the two-way communication, either between us and the silent entity, or between different kinds of silent entities?</p>


<h2 id="review">Review of the project</h2>

<p>There are four aspects on which this project is reviewed</p>

<ol>
<li>the narrative: what is the story you tell with regards to your translation? Why do you take these aspects of the entity's world and why do you choose the translation (visualisation, interaction) that you have chosen? Is the narrative non-trivial and convincing?</li>
<li>technical realisation: does the installation work? Does it give the mute entity the possibility of transmitting certain messages? Does the realisation fit the narrative?</li>
<li>design: is the installation finished? Is the design thought-through, complete and convincing? Is the realisation based on concrete design-decisions? Does the design fit the narrative? </li>
<li>documentation: is the documentation complete and thorough? Can we follow the (creative, intellectual, collaborative) steps you have taken throughout the project?</li>
</ol>
