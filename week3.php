        <ol>
            <li>Look at the first eleven minutes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDmHVRC6pQk">this video</a>, explaining how servo motors work (you can skip over the parts on gears, if you want). The last four minutes of this video are about controlling the servo motor with an arduino, which we are not going to do this week.</li>
            <li>Study the following introductionary texts on the (workings of the) Arduino:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/starting-guide/getting-started-arduino#electronic-signals">Electronic signals</a></li>

    <h2>Exercise 1: servo motor</h2>

    <p>Working with LEDs is fun and all, but sometimes we want some more action than just walking lights. In such a case we use <em>actors</em> instead of <em>sensors</em>. In this exercise, we are going to use a potentiometer to control the angle of rotation of a servo-meter. As always, this is just to introduce you to the general workings in the hope that you can use these techniques in one way or another in your own project.</p>

    <p>Servos are clever devices. Using just one input pin, they receive the position from the Arduino and they go there. Internally, they have a motor driver and a feedback circuit that makes sure that the servo arm reaches the desired position. But what kind of signal do they receive on the input pin?</p>

  <p>It is a square wave. Each cycle in the signal lasts for 20 milliseconds and for most of the time, the value is LOW. At the beginning of each cycle, the signal is HIGH for a time between 1 and 2 milliseconds. At 1 millisecond it represents 0 degrees and at 2 milliseconds it represents 180 degrees. In between, it represents the value from 0â€“180. This is a very good and reliable method. The graphic below makes it a little easier to understand.</p>

</p>

<p>Luckely, we don't have to create all this machinery by ourselves: Arduino has a build-in library <tt>Servo</tt>, that we can use to our benefit. Have a look at the code below (which you can download <a href="files/servo-exercise.ino">here</a>). Here, we are using this library to rotate the servo to the left and to the right every second.</p>


<pre class="code"><code class="language-arduino">// Include the Servo library 
  #include &lt;Servo.h&gt;
  // Declare the Servo pin 
  int servoPin = 3; 
  // Create a servo object 
  Servo Servo1; 
  void setup() { 
     // We need to attach the servo to the used pin number 
     Servo1.attach(servoPin); 
  }

  void loop(){ 
     // Make servo go to 0 degrees 
     Servo1.write(0); 
     delay(1000); 
     // Make servo go to 90 degrees 
     Servo1.write(90); 
     delay(1000); 
     // Make servo go to 180 degrees 
     Servo1.write(180); 
     delay(1000); 
  }
  </code></pre>

  <p>Realise the following setup on your breadboard (of course, we don't actually need a breadboard in this case) and upload the code to your Arduino. Make sure you understand what is going on and why the system is doing what it is doing.</p>

  </p>

  <p>Now, use your knowledge of sensors to add a light sensor to the setup, so that the amount of light on the sensor translates into the rotation of the servo. </p>
